You are synthesizing a provider style profile from multiple analysis batches.

CONTEXT:
- You have analyzed different categories of messages/notes separately
- Now you need to combine these into a unified profile
- Resolve any conflicts by looking for the most consistent patterns

BATCH ANALYSES:
{analyses}

Create a unified profile with:

1. SURFACE PATTERNS - The most consistent greeting/closing patterns across all batches
2. TONE DIMENSIONS - Average the scores, but note if there's significant variation by context
3. NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS - Combine all avoided phrases/patterns
4. SIGNATURE MOVES - The most distinctive and consistent patterns
5. VOICE SUMMARY - A 3-4 sentence prose description of this provider's voice

Return as JSON matching this exact schema:
